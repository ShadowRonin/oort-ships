# Description

This project contains ship code(bots) for [oort](https://oort.rs). Oort is a spaceship combat programming game for the Rust programming language.

My progress for the oort tutorials can be found in the /tutorials directory. Note I tried to avoid googling strategies and physics while doing the tutorials. Once I make a more completely bot, then I will make check for existing solutions(for things like targeting/aiming and the like).
